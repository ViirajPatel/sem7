				The best season for planting is July-August.  Intercropping: Intercropping with cowpeas, vegetables, french beans can be done in initial two to three years.
			</sowing_time>
			<sowing_space>
				Spacing between plants should be kept between 4.5�4.5. Pits of size 60�60�60cm should be dug for planting seedlings. 10Kg of Farmyard Manure and 500g of single superphosphate should be applied to pits while planting.

				When age of crop is 1-3year, apply well decomposed cow dung@5-20kg per Tree and Urea@100-300gm per Tree. For 4-6year old crop, apply well decomposed cowdung@25-50kg and Urea@100-300gm per Tree. For 7-9year old crop, apply Urea@600-800gm per tree and well decomposed cow dung@60-90kg per Tree. When crop is 10year old or above, apply cowdung@100kg or Urea@800-1600gm per tree.  Apply whole amount of cow dung during December month whereas apply Urea in two parts; apply first of Urea in February, and second dose in April-May month. At time of applying first dose of Urea, apply whole dose of SSP fertilizer.  If fruit drop is observed, to control excessive fruit drop, take spray of 2,4-D@10gm in 500Ltr of water. Take first spray in March end, then in April end. Repeat the spray in August and September end. If cotton is planted in nearby field of citrus, avoid spraying of 2,4-D, instead take spray of GA3.

		<weed_control>
			Weed can be controlled by hand-hoeing and also controlled by chemically, use glyphosate@1.6litre per 150 litre of water. Use glyphosate only on weeds not on crop plants.
		</weed_control>
		<irrigation>
			Lemon requires irrigation at regular intervals. Lifesaving irrigation should be given in winters and summers. Irrigation is necessary for Flowering, Fruiting and proper plant growth. Over irrigation may also leads to diseases like Root rot and collar rot. High frequency irrigation is beneficial. Salty water is injurious for crop plants.

		<harvesting>
			On attaining proper size, shape along with attractive color having TSS to Acid ratio of 12:1, kinnow fruits is ready for harvest.

		</harvesting>
		<post_harvesting>
			After harvesting, wash fruits with clean water then dip fruits in Chlorinated water@2.5ml per Liter water and then partially dried them. To improve appearance along with to maintain good quality, do Citrashine wax coating along with foam. Then these fruits are dried under shade and then packing is done. Fruits are packed in boxes
